# SPEC

## §G GOAL

`kittenscrew` — Rust CLI. Wraps squeez hooks (fork: `mi4uu/squeez`) w/ own
hooks. Adds spec/plan management, kitty:says() visual wrapper, per-project
config. Deterministic, fast, agent calls it via commands — never writes
SPEC.md directly.
Division of labor: squeez owns compression/dedup/queue/session-memory/
token-tracking → kittenscrew NEVER reimplements those, only wraps. kittenscrew
owns the gap squeez leaves: SPEC/plan/task mgmt, per-project config,
kitty voice, per-task docs. Offload to deterministic Rust what doesn't need
an LLM; leave judgement (intent, prose) to the LLM.
North star: ⊥ just fewer tokens — move work DOWN the model-size ladder w/o quality loss. Offloading deterministic work (plan/validate/diff/scan) to Rust frees a SMALL model's scarce reasoning for genuine judgement → small models become viable. Front-loaded context (the ~50k-on-`hi` bloat) cut via on-demand structured retrieval + caveman + squeez → working room for small models. Safe b/c deterministic gates (spec apply §V-validate, check done, value-variance, drift) = a hard quality FLOOR that catches a small model's slips. Prove via `benchmarks/agency`: {model tier} × {kittenscrew on|off} → quality + tokens + $.

## §C CONSTRAINTS

- Rust ≥ 1.75, single binary, ≤ 2MB stripped, 0 runtime deps except `squeez` binary.
- AGENT-AGNOSTIC: core = CLI contract (stdin/stdout JSON + exit codes V1) callable by ANY agent (Claude Code, Pi, …) — most share the same skills/commands. ⊥ hardcode any single agent's tooling (no CC `Agent`/`Workflow` baked into core). Hook-layer = the ONLY CC-specific adapter, isolated behind `kittenscrew hook <event>`; other agents wire their own trigger → identical deterministic core. Skills/commands authored portable (FORMAT.md/SKILL.md read by all).
- kittenscrew = self-contained cargo workspace (own `[workspace]` in its Cargo.toml) → ⊥ inherit external workspace root (repo isn't a Rust project).
- squeez = binary on PATH (`$HOME/.claude/squeez/bin/squeez` or `which squeez`). Never link library — squeez publishes NO crate/lib API, binary only. Fork `mi4uu/squeez` = backup mirror, ⊥ source of an extracted lib.
- squeez config = global INI `~/.claude/squeez/config.ini`. kittenscrew.toml = per-project, additive, ⊥ overlaps/overrides squeez's INI.
- ⊥ reimplement any squeez feature (compression, dedup, redundancy-queue, session-memory, token-track, nudges). Wrap only.
- `.kittenscrew/spec.toml` = SOLE source of truth (structured, deterministic, `schema=1`). SPEC.md = rendered projection for agents/cavekit compat, regenerated on every mutating cmd. `.kittenscrew/*.json` = ephemeral checkpoint only.
- `kittenscrew.toml` (per-project config) ≠ `.kittenscrew/spec.toml` (plan store) — distinct files, distinct purpose.
- Plan = DAG (task = node, dep = edge). Linear order ⊥ stored — derived via topo-sort on demand. Task may have many deps + many dependents → graph, not tree.
- SPEC.md format = existing `FORMAT.md` (pipe-table, caveman). Backward compat.
- `spec import` ! tolerate real-world variance (FORMAT.md is aspirational, real specs diverge): aligned/code-fenced §T tables, `desc` vs `task` header, unescaped `|`/`||` in task prose (anchor id+status front, cites back), 3 invariant styles (`Vn:` | `Vn \| …` | `- Vn slug:`), continuation sections (`## §V … cont.`) accumulate, non-standard `## §U …` ignored. Validated vs 5 real specs (botm/brainmd/codeHarness/maxijinja/opengraphene).
- Per-project config = `kittenscrew.toml` (TOML). Optional. Defaults if absent.
- Hooks = bash shims → delegate to `kittenscrew` → delegates to `squeez`. Never bypass squeez for compression.
- Wrap ALL 6 squeez hooks: SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SubagentStop, PreCompact, PostCompact.
- `claudeoneprovider.sh` / `claudeopenrouter.sh` keep working — add `PATH` line only.

## §I INTERFACES

- cmd: `kittenscrew --version` → `kittenscrew 0.1.0`
- cmd: `kittenscrew kitty says <kitty> <message>` → stdout: `😽📐 [Planning Kitty] message`
- cmd: `kittenscrew kitty list` → stdout: pipe-table of {id, emoji, name, role}

- cmd: `kittenscrew spec apply` → stdin = STRUCTURED JSON diff `{section:"§T", op:"add|edit|kill|done", payload:{…}}` → exits 0 + updated SPEC.md, exits 2 + message on §V violation. ⊥ parses freeform prose intent — caller (LLM) supplies structure; kittenscrew only validates+writes+orders.
- cmd: `kittenscrew docs task <id>` → write `docs/<id>-<slug>.md` describing what+why for done task. OFF by default (`[docs] auto_generate=false`). Detail level from `[docs] detail` (terse|normal|explain).
- cmd: `kittenscrew spec check` → stdout: list of {id, status, cites} for §V
- cmd: `kittenscrew plan resolve` → stdout: JSON `{tasks:[{id,deps,order}], roots:[…]}` (topo-sort of DAG)
- cmd: `kittenscrew plan ready` → stdout: JSON `[…]` ALL unblocked `.` tasks (deps all `x`), sorted by priority → the parallelizable batch

- cmd: `kittenscrew plan blocking <id>` → stdout: tasks blocked by `<id>` (reverse-dep query)

- cmd: `kittenscrew spec render` → regenerate SPEC.md from `.kittenscrew/spec.toml`
- cmd: `kittenscrew spec import` → parse SPEC.md → `.kittenscrew/spec.toml` (bootstrap / re-sync after manual edit)
- cmd: `kittenscrew spec drift [--apply]` → diff edited SPEC.md vs store projection → report {task_added,removed,changed, prose_changed}; `--apply` reconciles structural + carries toml-only fields + re-renders (V16)
- cmd: `kittenscrew plan graph` → ASCII DAG render of tasks+deps (someday/optional, presentation-only)
- file: `.kittenscrew/spec.toml` → authoritative structured store (`schema=1`): `[goal]`,`[constraints]`,`[[interface]]`,`[[invariant]]`,`[[task]]` (id,status,deps,priority,cites,scope,note),`[[bug]]`
- cmd: `kittenscrew plan done <id>` → flips status → Done in store, re-renders SPEC.md projection
- cmd: `kittenscrew plan impact <id>` → JSON {scope, unblocks[], blocks[]}
- cmd: `kittenscrew plan path [<goal>]` → JSON {path[], length} critical/longest prereq chain
- cmd: `kittenscrew plan alternatives` → JSON [{id, task, scope, unblocks, blocks}] frontier choices
- cmd: `kittenscrew hook <event>` → runs hook logic for SessionStart|PreToolUse|PostToolUse|PreCompact
- cmd: `kittenscrew score` → JSON graded conformance: {overall, dims:[{name, pct, detail}]} (interface-completeness, check-done-pass, dep-coverage, value-coverage, sync) — convergence metric, ⊥ binary
- cmd: `kittenscrew config show` → resolved `kittenscrew.toml` (defaults if absent) → JSON
- cmd: `kittenscrew init` → writes `kittenscrew.toml` template, registers hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- file: `kittenscrew.toml` schema → `[kitty] compression_level`, `[hooks] pre, post, session, compact`, `[docs] auto_generate, detail (terse|normal|explain), target (dev|idiot)`, `[plan] strict_ordering, forward_agg (max|sum|hybrid), discount, portfolio_weight, rank_by (worth|roi|expected)`, `[audit] recheck_every_tasks, recheck_every_iters, variance_threshold, on_variance (report|brainstorm|halt)`, `[guard] blocked_cmds=[…]`
- env: `KITTENSCREW_CONFIG` → path to config (default `./kittenscrew.toml`)
- env: `SQUEEZ_BIN` → path to squeez binary (default auto-detect)

## §V INVARIANTS

V1: ∀ kittenscrew cmd → exits 0 on success, 2 on validation fail, 1 on internal error
V2: `kittenscrew hook <event>` ! exits nonzero if squeez missing — log + continue (graceful degrade)
V3: `kittenscrew spec apply` ⊥ writes to SPEC.md if diff violates any §V rule — emits warning + returns diff to caller
V4: `kittenscrew plan resolve` → ∀ §T task ! appears in exactly 1 position in topo-sort
V5: `kittenscrew kitty says` output ! includes kitty emoji + `[Name]` prefix + raw message — no mutation of message
V6: `kittenscrew init` ! registers hooks only after verifying `squeez` reachable — exit 3 if not
V7: hook shims ! invoke `squeez` directly — always via `kittenscrew` (single entry point)
V8: ∀ command output → caveman format w/ symbols (→, ∀, ⊥, ∅, !)
V9: `.kittenscrew/spec.toml` = authoritative store → SPEC.md = deterministic projection, regenerated by `kittenscrew`, ⊥ hand-authored as truth
V10: kittenscrew ⊥ implements compression/dedup/session-memory → ∀ such work delegates to squeez binary
V11: `kittenscrew spec apply` accepts STRUCTURED diff only → ⊥ infers intent from prose; malformed JSON → exit 2
V12: `kittenscrew docs task` ⊥ runs unless `[docs] auto_generate=true` → default silent
V13: plan = DAG; linear order ⊥ stored → topo-sort computed on demand (insert/edit deps → recompute O(V+E), no renumber)
V14: dep edit/insert creating cycle → reject exit 2 + report cycle path
V15: priority = tiebreak among READY (unblocked) tasks only → ⊥ overrides deps
V16: agent edits SPEC.md directly → drift; next hook diffs SPEC.md vs projection → structured change auto-reconciled into store, ambiguous prose → escalate to LLM w/ structured summary
V17: `plan ready` → ALL unblocked `.` tasks (parallel batch); tasks w/ no dep-path between them (same antichain) → MAY run concurrently
V18: `check done` (cyclic eval) → ∀ `x` task: scan `scope` for fake-delivery (`TODO|FIXME|stub|mock|placeholder|todo!()|unimplemented!()`) + cited §V intact → fail → demote `x`→`~` + report
V19: `x` task = sealed → change flipping its `check done` green→red = regression alarm, ⊥ silent
V20: ∀ path/impact/alternatives query → deterministic (same store → same result), O(V+E) graph walk, ⊥ LLM. Reports scope delivered + edges unblocked/blocked per choice
V21: `spec read --plain` expands ONLY unambiguous unicode symbols (→ ∴ ∀ ∃ ⊥ ∅ ≠ ∈ ∉ ≤ ≥) → lossless; ASCII overloads (! ? & |) + table delimiters untouched (collide w/ prose/code). ⊥ store expanded form — derive on demand (single source of truth, V9)
V22: `plan next`/`alternatives` rank by `worth` (value-weighted) → ⊥ pure cheapness/id. zapychacz (value≈0, unblocks=0) → worth≈0 → sinks choćby difficulty=1. low-hanging fruit wins ONLY when worth real
V23: task carries `value`,`difficulty`,`risk` (1-5, authored @ creation) + `[task.eval]` `satisfaction`,`conformance`,`tokens` (@ done). ~free — AI already judges @ plan + self-evals @ done → capture the signal, ⊥ recompute
V24: `worth = value + γ·forward`; `forward = max(worth children) + portfolio_weight·Σ(worth children)` (hybrid, `[plan]` config); `rank = ROI·(1−risk/6)`, `ROI = worth/difficulty`. deterministic O(V+E), ⊥ LLM @ query (V20)
V25: done-eval = 2 loops → `check done` (delivered: fake-delivery scan, V18) + `value-variance` (worth: eval `satisfaction·conformance` vs authored `value` → magnitude+direction+why). cadence per `[audit]` (every N tasks|iters)
V26: deliberation = composable pipe of fixed-size primitives {`brainstorm`,`research`,`evaluate`,`ask`}, configured per project (e.g. `brainstorm|research|brainstorm|ask`). each primitive = bounded brick w/ sane default (brainstorm ≈ 3 agents × 5 turns, config-overridable) → scale by COMPOSITION (`brainstorm|brainstorm` = 2 rounds), ⊥ by raising caps. pipe length = transparent total cost; ⊥ unbounded gadanie
V27: deliberation ! terminates in `ask` = user-choice decision packet {agreed, options[{proposal,cost,risk}], recommend} → ⊥ auto-apply. Rust = orchestrate/bound/scribe/present, LLM kitties = judgement (debate/attack/defend); roster+chair per config
V28: ∀ §I-declared `cmd:` ! resolve to a real binary subcommand (interface-completeness gate) → deterministic test asserts §I cmds ⊆ clap subcommand tree; built-but-undeclared also flagged. catches §I↔code drift that `check`/`drift` can't (they watch store↔SPEC.md, ⊥ §I↔binary). Lesson forged: silent interface debt → hard floor
V29: remote review = OPTIONAL advisory primitive (config roster of remote agents via OpenRouter: {key, model, role-desc}) → gets diff + ONLY the relevant spec fragment (⊥ whole spec) → returns few-sentence notes/suggestions → ⊥ blocks, ⊥ auto-applies; feeds deliberation (eval|brainstorm|ask). 0-runtime-dep (§C) → shell to `curl`, ⊥ link HTTP crate. absent config → silently skipped
V30: render-triggering cmd (`spec apply`/`plan done`/`check done` demote) ! verify SPEC.md ≡ store projection FIRST (`is_synced`) → diverges (manual prose edit pending) → abort exit 2 + suggest `spec drift --apply`, ⊥ silently clobber the edit
V31: conformance = GRADED %, ⊥ binary pass/fail. score dims (§I-completeness, `check done` pass-rate, dep-coverage, sync, invariant-test coverage) → 0-100% each + aggregate. weird spec≠code case → lock w/ specific + generic unit test AND it dents the % until fixed → track convergence over commits, ⊥ expect all-at-once
